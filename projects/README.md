# FlipperX

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
FlipperX is an expansion board for the popular multitool Flipper zero. This board uses the GPIO ports to connect to the Flipper. It has GPS, ESP32, LEDS, external CC1101 module and
breakout pins so it can be expanded in the future.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The manufacturing on 5 pcb's with the first time deal on JLCPCB costs $2.43.
The assembly of 2 PCB's costs $43.96.
NOTE: The female header pins on the to and bottom, the male pins, the neopixel led, the esp32 xiao module, and the ebyte cc1101 module is bought seperately.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? -->
All the other GPIO expansion boards on the market were super expensive, had limited functionalty compared to mine and were really big and bulky.
Thats why I decided to take on the challange of designing my own board that fit into the footprint of a Flipper (20mmx100mm). The real challange was routing all the traces,
there were so many of them and the board was really small.
